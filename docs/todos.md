# frederick-matrix — TODOs

*Last updated: 2026-02-15*

## 📊 Summary

**Total Items:** 50+ tasks across 7 categories
**Completed:** 3 ✅
**High Priority:** 3 items (stable DNS, onboarding docs, backups)
**Blockers:** 1 (federation blocked by server_name issue)

### 🎯 Next Actions (Recommended Order)
1. **Set up DuckDNS + Named Tunnel** — solves both stability and network compatibility issues
2. **Create onboarding guide** — improve friend experience
3. **Implement backup script** — protect against data loss
4. **Add tests** — prevent regressions as project grows
5. **Fix server_name** — enable true federation

---

## 🚨 Critical / Blocking

- [ ] 🔍 **Tunnel is unreliable on restrictive networks** — Cloudflare quick tunnels use QUIC which is blocked on many WiFi networks (coffee shops, etc). Investigate alternatives:
  - [ ] 🦆 DuckDNS + port forwarding (stable hostname, no tunnel needed if port 443/8448 open)
  - [ ] 📋 **DuckDNS + Cloudflare named tunnel** (free tier, stable URL, falls back to HTTP/2) — *Recommended path, see docs/named-tunnel.md*
  - [ ] 🔐 Tailscale / Wireguard as alternative for peer-to-peer connectivity
  - [ ] 🌐 ngrok (supports TCP, less QUIC-dependent)
- [ ] ⏰ **Tunnel URLs are ephemeral** — every restart gets a new random `trycloudflare.com` domain. Friends' Element clients break until they update homeserver URL. A stable DNS name (DuckDNS, own domain, etc.) would fix this permanently. *Note: Addressed by switching to named tunnel with stable domain.*

## 🐛 Bugs

- [x] ✅ **`make publish` SHA detection bug** — `gh api` returns 404 JSON but exits 0 when using `--jq`, so the `|| echo ""` fallback never triggers. The SHA variable gets the error JSON string (non-empty), which accidentally still works but for the wrong reason. **FIXED (2026-02-14):** Now properly handles 404 by piping full response through jq with `// ""` fallback.
- [x] ✅ **`make tunnel-url` reports stale URLs** — greps historical docker logs, so it returns the last URL even if the tunnel died hours ago and DNS no longer resolves. **FIXED (2026-02-14):** Now shows timestamp of when URL was last seen in logs, checks reachability with curl, and displays clear LIVE/UNREACHABLE status.
- [ ] 💡 **`docker compose logs` accumulates across restarts** — `tunnel-url` and `publish` both grep full log history. If container is recreated vs restarted, log behavior differs. Consider writing current URL to a file (`/tmp/tunnel-url`) on successful registration instead of log-grepping. *Note: Partially mitigated by timestamp check in `make tunnel-url`, but persisting to file would be more reliable.*
  - [ ] Create helper script to persist tunnel URL to `data/tunnel-url`
  - [ ] Update `make tunnel-url` to read from file first, fall back to logs
  - [ ] Update tunnel startup to call the helper script

## 🏗️ Infrastructure

- [ ] 🚀 **Stable DNS** — Replace ephemeral trycloudflare URLs with a stable hostname **(HIGH PRIORITY)**
  - [ ] 🦆 Evaluate DuckDNS (free dynamic DNS, supports subdomains)
  - [ ] ⏰ Auto-update DNS on tunnel/IP change (cron or systemd timer)
  - [ ] 📤 Update `make publish` to push stable URL (won't need to republish on every restart)
- [ ] 🔒 **SSL/TLS for federation** — Matrix federation requires valid TLS on port 8448. Currently the Cloudflare tunnel handles this. Without a tunnel, need:
  - [ ] 🔐 Let's Encrypt / certbot for the DuckDNS domain
  - [ ] 🔄 Reverse proxy (nginx/caddy) in front of Synapse
- [ ] 💾 **Persist tunnel URL to file** — On successful tunnel creation, write URL to `data/tunnel-url` so Makefile targets don't depend on log-grepping **(MEDIUM PRIORITY)**
- [ ] 🔄 **Auto-reconnect / health check** — Script or systemd unit that monitors tunnel health and restarts cloudflared (or switches to backup) when it dies
  - [ ] Create health check script that curls tunnel URL
  - [ ] Add systemd timer or cron job to run every 5 minutes
  - [ ] Auto-restart docker compose on failure
- [ ] 🤔 **`make start` vs `make up` overlap** — `start.sh` runs a foreground watcher loop; `make up` now also publishes. Clarify which is canonical or merge them.
  - [ ] Document intended use case for each command
  - [ ] Consider deprecating one or merging functionality

## 🌐 GitHub Pages / Hosted Element

- [ ] 🗂️ **Config caching** — After workflow deploys, browsers may cache old `config.json` with stale homeserver URL. Add cache-control headers or version-bust the config fetch in Element.
  - [ ] Add cache-busting query param (e.g., `?v=timestamp`) to config.json fetch
  - [ ] Set appropriate Cache-Control headers in GitHub Pages config
- [ ] ⏱️ **`home.html` peer loading** — Peers section fetches each peer's `server.json` but doesn't handle slow/dead peers gracefully (no timeout indicator per peer, just silent failure).
  - [ ] Add loading spinner per peer
  - [ ] Add timeout (5s?) with error indicator
  - [ ] Show last successful fetch timestamp
- [ ] 🎨 **Registration flow UX** — New users need to: open Pages link → register with token. Could improve with:
  - [ ] 📄 Landing page that explains what this is before dumping into Element
  - [ ] 🔑 Token entry integrated into the status page
  - [ ] 📱 Better mobile experience for onboarding
- [ ] 📦 **Element version pinned to v1.12.10** — Should periodically update. Add a `make element-update` or note the manual process.
  - [ ] Create `make element-update` target
  - [ ] Document manual update steps in docs/operations.md

## 🌐 Mesh / Federation

- [ ] 🔗 **Federation not tested** — Multiple nodes discovering each other via `peers.json` is set up, but actual Matrix federation between Synapse instances hasn't been verified. Requires: **(BLOCKED by server_name issue)**
  - [ ] 🏃 Two running nodes with stable URLs
  - [ ] ⚙️ Proper `server_name` config (currently `localhost`, which won't federate)
  - [ ] 🔍 `.well-known` delegation or SRV records
  - [ ] 🧪 Test message sent between federated nodes
- [ ] ⚠️ **`server_name: localhost` problem** — Synapse is configured with `server_name: localhost`. User IDs are `@user:localhost`. This works for single-node but blocks federation. Changing server_name later requires a fresh database. Plan migration path. **(BREAKING CHANGE)**
  - [ ] 📝 Document migration process
  - [ ] Create migration script to backup data
  - [ ] Test server_name change in dev environment
  - [ ] Communicate breaking change to users
- [ ] 🤖 **Peer discovery is manual** — `peers.json` is hand-edited. Could automate: each node publishes to a shared registry (GitHub repo, or a known "seed" node's API).
  - [ ] Design peer registry format (GitHub repo with JSON files?)
  - [ ] Create `make register-peer` to publish to registry
  - [ ] Create `make discover-peers` to pull from registry
  - [ ] Add automatic peer discovery on startup (optional)

## 🛠️ Developer Experience

- [ ] 🧪 **No tests** — No automated verification that the stack works after changes **(MEDIUM PRIORITY)**
  - [ ] 🎭 Playwright smoke test: `make up` → register → send message → verify
  - [ ] 🔄 CI: workflow that spins up Synapse, runs health check
  - [ ] 📊 Test coverage reporting
  - [ ] 🏷️ Version tagging and release process
- [ ] 🌍 **`workshed playwright` needs Chrome** — WSL environment doesn't have Chrome installed. Either:
  - [ ] 📦 Add Chrome install to setup docs
  - [ ] 🎭 Use `playwright install chromium` (Playwright's bundled browser) — *Recommended*
- [ ] 📝 **Makefile getting large** — Consider splitting into `scripts/` for complex targets (publish, tunnel-url) and keeping Makefile as thin wrappers.
  - [ ] Move complex bash logic to `scripts/publish.sh`
  - [ ] Move tunnel-url logic to `scripts/check-tunnel.sh`
  - [ ] Keep Makefile as simple interface layer

## 📚 Documentation

- [x] ✅ **docs/ committed but not linked from README** — **FIXED (2026-02-14):** Added a new "Documentation" section to README.md with direct links to all docs: quickstart, architecture, setup, operations, named-tunnel, and networking guides.
- [ ] 👥 **Onboarding guide for friends** — Non-technical guide: "Here's a link, here's your token, click register." Currently docs are operator-focused. **(HIGH PRIORITY for user growth)**
  - [ ] Create `docs/onboarding.md` for end users
  - [ ] Add visual screenshots of registration flow
  - [ ] Create troubleshooting FAQ for common user issues
  - [ ] Add "getting started" video or GIF walkthrough
- [ ] 🔧 **Troubleshooting: network requirements** — Document that QUIC (UDP 7844) must be open for Cloudflare quick tunnels. List known-broken networks.
  - [ ] Create `docs/troubleshooting.md`
  - [ ] List network requirements (QUIC/UDP, firewall rules)
  - [ ] Document known incompatible networks (coffee shops, corporate WiFi)
  - [ ] Add fallback options (named tunnel, Tailscale)

## ✨ Nice to Have

- [ ] 🤖 **Matrix bot** — Auto-welcome bot in `#general`, bridge to other services
  - [ ] Research Matrix bot frameworks (matrix-nio, mautrix)
  - [ ] Create welcome bot that greets new users
  - [ ] Add bridge to Discord/Slack (optional)
